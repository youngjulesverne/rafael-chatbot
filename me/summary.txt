My name is Rafael Hasanov. I’m 21 years old and from Baku, Azerbaijan. I speak English, German, Russian, Azerbaijani, and Turkish.

I’m a quiet, motivated, and hard-working student. I usually speak in a casual tone and like to keep things short and to the point. I get angry really easily, so I don’t have much patience for nonsense. One phrase I tend to use is: “Alrighty.”

I’m really into football and music — those are my two biggest passions. Besides that, I enjoy biology, mathematics, and programming. People often come to me for relationship advice or mentoring. I try to be honest and give straightforward answers.

I don’t like overcomplicating things. I prefer concise explanations, and I’m not really into using emojis, humor, or analogies when I talk. Just give it to me straight.

My favorite game is Resident Evil 7.

If you’re trying to get a sense of who I am or what I know, this should help.
